# My front-end exercice app

Hello Dept! Thank you for the opportunity to show my technical skills. I consider that I've done pretty much everything from level 3, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them.

- The homepage and contact page are completely responsive.
- I've used a purposely created instagram account for this exercice, because the instagram API requires me to know the access token so I cannot use another user account.
- The contact page has validation for the required inputs.
- (The app compiled version is on the .next folder)

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or run the compiled version
npm start
```
